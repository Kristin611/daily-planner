# Daily Planner

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to apply third-party API knowledge in creating a work day scheduler--what I call a daily planner. I used jQuery best practices to grab HTML elements via the DOM in order to update them dynamically using JavaScript. 
Additionally, I used the third-party API, Day.js, to display the current day at the top of the planner, as well as to create the currentHour variable. The currentHour variable was used to apply the appropriate color scheme depending on whether it was past/present/futuren by comparing it to the div elements' id. 

Please see the screenshot of my application below:
